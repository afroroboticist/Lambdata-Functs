# Lambdata-Functs
A Project for DS23 SPRINT 1 which develops a Class which inherits from the Pandas DataFrame and executes a few useful methods.

## FILES OF INTEREST


# helper_functions.py
This contains the main class (MyDataFrame).
MyDataFrame inhertis from the Pandas DataFrame class and implements 3 new methods
- null_count : Counts and returns total NA values in your dataframe
- randomize : jumbles up your dataframe so no cell remains in its original position
- train_test_split: takes a split frac and uses that in splitting your dataframe without shuffling it.

# test_lambdata.py
This py file is responsible for running tests on the Class in helper_functions.py
